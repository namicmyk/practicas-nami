    <h1> [Verse 1]
Beat me, break me down but I'm still standing
Picking pieces off the ground again
If one day I fall, just hope I stick the landing
Not at the gates screaming to let me in
But I don't know where to start

[Chorus]
Damned if I do, it's way too late to fix it
I'll be damned if I don't, the bane of my existence
They said "Damn kid, you gotta try
Even if you never win, you can't pretend
You'll never be happy again"

[Verse 2]
Clip his wings, he don't deserve the halo
I'm losing faith in everyone again
If the TV stations sell their lies on cable
Then we're so blind that we'll be tuning in
But I don't know where to start

[Chorus]
Damned if I do, it's way too late to fix it
I'll be damned if I don't, the bane of my existence
They said "Damn kid, you gotta try
Even if you never win, you can't pretend
You'll never be happy ag-"

[Bridge]
Holding on to nothing
'Till it turns into something
Don't like who I'm becoming
I can't keep running
Searching for an answer
Re-reading every chapter
There's no happy ever after when it's over

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Damned if I do, it's way too late to fix it
I'll be damned if I don't, the bane of my existence
They said "Damn kid, you gotta try
Even if you never win, you can't pretend
You'll never be happy again" </h1>
